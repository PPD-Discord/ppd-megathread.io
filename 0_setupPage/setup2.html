      <h1 id="FirstTime">- Opening PPD For The First Time -</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">PPD can be played with a keyboard or a variety of controllers (typically a DS4).</p>
        <p style="font-size: large;"><mark>Before connecting a controller, be sure to complete the following steps first with a keyboard.</mark></p>
        <p>This guide will help you install a base version of PPD. To make the game look more like official Project Diva games, we will install mods later in this guide. For now, follow along:</p>

        <p>1. Starting the PPD application for the first time will trigger an update. After this update is completed, you'll be met with this box:</p>
        <img src="../0_setupPage/images/first-time-step1.png">
        <p>If you made an account beforehand, go ahead and enter your account info. If not, hit cancel and the game will start normally.</p>
        
        <p>2. You'll be met with this screen and will need to navigate with the mouse initially:</p>
        <img src="../0_setupPage/images/first-time-step2-p1.png">
        <p>Click the arrow pointing to the right on the screen to progress. Continue to navigate until you arrive at the in-game inputs screen (Assign Key/Button).</p>
        <img src="../0_setupPage/images/recommended-controls.PNG">
        <p> Use the "Change" buttons to change the desired key/button bindings to whatever you like. These are our recommended controls. On keyboard, it is recommended to change the Home button to a more uncommon/unused key.</p>
        
        <p>3. Once you are done, you will arrive at this screen. Use your new L and R buttons to navigate the menus.</p>
        <img src="../0_setupPage/images/first-time-step3-p1.png">
        <img src="../0_setupPage/images/first-time-step3-p2.png">
        <p>From here, you can play with a keyboard if you wish.</p>
        <p>Just be sure to <a href="../0_setupPage/setup6.html">add some songs</a> to play and <a href="../0_setupPage/setup3.html">download our highly recommended/necessary mods</a> first!</p>
        <p>Press the key your circle button is binded to to confirm and start single-player or multiplayer mode.</p>
        <p>To play with a controller, <mark>close PPD</mark> and continue with the <a href="../0_setupPage/setup4.html">controller setup guide</a>.</p>
