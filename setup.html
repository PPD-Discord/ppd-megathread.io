      <p style="font-size: large;"><strong>*You do not need a PPD account to play the game; however, you must have an account to save scores, upload custom charts, and have a profile picture + name during multiplayer.</strong></p style>
      <p>3. Click the blue "PPD Installer (64bit)" button. This will download the PPDInstaller to your PC.</p>

      <p>You have now downloaded PPD!</p>

      <h1 id="FirstTime">- Opening PPD For The First Time -</h1>
      <p style="font-size: large;">PPD can be played with a keyboard or a variety of controllers (typically a DS4).</p style>
      <p style="font-size: large;"><mark>Before connecting a controller, be sure to complete the following steps first.</mark></p style>
      <p>1. Starting the PPD application for the first time will trigger an update. After this update is completed, you'll be met with this box:</p>
      <img src="0_setupPage/images/first-time-step1.png">
      <p>If you made an account beforehand, go ahead and enter your account info. If not, hit cancel and the game will start normally.</p>
      <p>2. You'll be met with this screen and will need to navigate with the mouse initially:</p>
      <img src="0_setupPage/images/first-time-step2-p1.png">
      <p>Click the arrow pointing to the right on the screen to progress. Continue to navigate until you arrive at the in game inputs screen.</p>
      <img src="0_setupPage/images/first-time-step2-p2.png">
      <p> Use the "Change" buttons to change the desired key/button bindings to whatever you like. On keyboard, it is recommended to change the Home button to a more uncommon/unused key.</p>
      <p>3. Once you are done, you will arrive at this screen. Use your new L and R buttons to navigate the menus.</p>
      <p>From here, you can play with a keyboard if you wish.</p>
      <p>Just be sure to add some songs to play first!</p>
      <p>Press the key your circle button is binded to to confirm and start single-player or multiplayer mode.</p>
      <p>To play with a controller, <mark>close PPD</mark> and continue with this guide.</p>


      <h1 id="MakingAccount">- Making an Account -</h1>
      <p style="font-size: large;"><strong><mark>Making an account is not necessary if you only want to play the game and not use account features (saving scores, uploading custom charts, having a profile picture + name during multiplayer, etc.)</mark></strong></p style>
      <p>1. Click the "sign up" tab at the top right corner of the <a target="blank" href="https://projectdxxx.me/">official PPD website.</a></p>
      <p><strong><mark>We highly recommend specifically clicking this "sign up" tab in the top right corner. The blue button has been known to not work.</mark></strong></p>
      <img src="0_setupPage/images/making-an-account-step1.png">
      <p>2. Enter a valid e-mail address and click "Register."</p>
      <img src="0_setupPage/images/making-an-account-step2.png">
      <p><strong><mark>Things to be mindful of when making an account:</mark></strong></p>
      <p>1. No username that's already be used.</p>
      <p>2. No E-Mail address that's already been used/deactivated.</p>
      <p>3. No symbols in the password (only alphanumeric + capitalization allowed)</p>
